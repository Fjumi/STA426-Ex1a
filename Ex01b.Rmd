```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


First, I create a data set called dd which samples 100 values from a normal distribution with mu = 1 and sigma = 0.25.

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
set.seed(1)
dd<-rnorm(100,mean=1,sd=0.25)
```


Next, I plot a histogram of this data:

```{r}
set.seed(1)
dd<-rnorm(100,mean=1,sd=0.25)
hist(dd)
print(paste('mean of dd =',mean(dd),'variance of dd =',var(dd)))
```

The mean of the distribution ist 1.03 and its variance is 0.05.


Next, I do the same for the distribution on the log-scale:

```{r}
set.seed(1)
dd<-rnorm(100,mean=1,sd=0.25)
hist(log(dd))
print(paste('mean =',mean(log(dd)),'variance =',var(log(dd))))
```


The mean of the log-transformed data is 0.00093 and its variance is 0.056.
